### Executive Summary

Using Test RPC We create a light weight ethereum emulator to deploy smart contracts into.

We next deploy the ClickButton Contract using the Coval-Solidity Deployment CLI Tool

We then start the REST server from the CLI allowing interaction with the deployed contracts.

Next (having previously set up a working gym environment we run click.py)

Click.py loads the `wob.mini.ClickButton-v0` environment to begin training a model to be able to click the button requested.

Each iteration of a task records the PointerEvent's within ethereum storage for later retrieval and and historical purposes.

Click.py communicates with the contract via REST over http here: http://127.0.0.1:4333/v1/Example/ClickButton/SaveEvent/exec?args=roundId,eventId,x,y,mask

### How to run
run test rpc in one terminal
run `npm run cleanup; npm run cleanup;`

deploy scenario "example"
`npm start`

launch rest from cli menu after deploying

in another terminal run `python click.py`
